## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Value-first onboarding: Show plan preview before payment to increase conversion
- Anonymous sessions: Let users complete questionnaire without account, create account only when committing
- Subscription-only model: Recurring revenue, no freemium complexity
- Monthly auto-regeneration: Keep users engaged, plans adapt to progress
- Dark theme default: Modern aesthetic, matches Runna/fitness app trends
- Designs per phase: Allows iterative refinement, prevents upfront design bottleneck

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**App Store Risk (SUB-06 note):** Using Stripe for digital subscriptions may violate Apple/Google policies requiring In-App Purchase. May need to pivot to IAP if rejected during review. Planning to proceed with Stripe for v1, monitor during TestFlight/beta phase.
